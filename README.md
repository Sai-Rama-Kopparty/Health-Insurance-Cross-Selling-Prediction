# Health-Insurance-Cross-Selling-Prediction

## Introduction

> The Health Insurance Cross Selling Prediction project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of customers purchasing additional health insurance policies. By analyzing historical data and customer profiles, the project aims to identify patterns and factors that influence cross-selling success. Through the application of various ML algorithms, such as logistic regression or decision trees, the model learns from past customer behavior to accurately forecast the probability of customers opting for supplementary insurance plans. This predictive capability enables insurance providers to optimize their cross-selling strategies, target potential customers more effectively, and ultimately increase their revenue and customer satisfaction.
